### Step 1: Welcome & Safety
**"Before We Begin"**

- Brief welcome from Starling
- Crisis resources displayed prominently
- "This is for self-exploration, not crisis intervention"
- Clear disclaimer about what MAGIE is/isn't
- Checkbox: "I understand this is not a replacement for crisis care"

**[I Understand - Continue]**

### Step 2: Is This For You?
**"Let's see if MAGIE might fit"**

Interactive self-assessment (not gatekeeping, just helping them decide):

Questions like:
- Do you process emotions through writing/talking?
- Are you comfortable with text-based reflection?
- Do you have access to an AI platform (or willing to try one)?
- Are you looking for self-directed exploration?

Results:
- "MAGIE might be a great fit for you"
- "MAGIE could work, with some adaptations"
- "You might benefit from other resources first" (with suggestions)

**[This Feels Right - Continue]**

### Step 3: Understanding MAGIE
**"What You're About To Practice"**

Short, digestible explanation:
- What MAGIE stands for (one letter at a time, animated/interactive)
- The core concept: You + AI + Primer = Healing Practice
- 3 key principles:
  - Your Primer is your continuity
  - Honesty with yourself is the practice
  - The AI is a mirror, not a therapist
